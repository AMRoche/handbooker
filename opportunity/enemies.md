## Nemeses
Below are listed enemies for usage in the Opportunity campaign setting.

<br/>

##### "Hacker"

Since computers and hacking often are a large part of a hard sci-fi setting, we’ve included one hacker profile. You can use this adversary as a sysop employed by a government or corporation, or as a criminal hacker. In all cases this is a dangerous adversary in the electronic realm.

##### "Intelligence Agent"

Intelligence agents—or spies, if you prefer—are some of the most cunning and elusive opponents encountered in modern day settings. Our spy is a jack-of-all-trades; they’re not an overly dangerous combatant, but their Adversary talent and One Step Ahead ability should make them a frustrating foe.

##### Combat Drone

Combat drones may be built in any number of shapes and designs. This one is a futuristic quad-rotor drone with weapons and with a weak AI that can let it operate somewhat autonomously.

Your groups of street toughs can be led by the gang leader, another go-to opponent who fits into all settings. The gang leader is a tough individual who runs smalltime criminal operations with an iron fist. This can be a good opponent for a group to face off with at the climax of their first or second session, especially if the gang leader is backed up by a minion group of street toughs.

<br>

##### Militarised Police / Trained Bodyguard

For a hard science fiction setting, we can assume at least some professional soldiers are equipped with full-body exosuits that enhance their strength while protecting them from damage. An exosuit increases the character’s Brawn, soak, and wound threshold, which we’ve incorporated into the profile stats and noted in the equipment. If you use an exosuit trooper without a suit, make sure you remove the increases from the profile stats.
