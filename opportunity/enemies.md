## Nemeses
Below are listed enemies for usage in the Opportunity campaign setting.

<br/>

##### "Hacker"

Since computers and hacking often are a large part of a hard sci-fi setting, we’ve included one hacker profile. You can use this adversary as a sysop employed by a government or corporation, or as a criminal hacker. In all cases this is a dangerous adversary in the electronic realm.

##### "Intelligence Agent"

Intelligence agents—or spies, if you prefer—are some of the most cunning and elusive opponents encountered in modern day settings. Our spy is a jack-of-all-trades; they’re not an overly dangerous combatant, but their Adversary talent and One Step Ahead ability should make them a frustrating foe.

##### Combat Drone

Combat drones may be built in any number of shapes and designs. This one is a futuristic quad-rotor drone with weapons and with a weak AI that can let it operate somewhat autonomously.

##### Enforcer

Your groups of street toughs can be led by the gang leader, another go-to opponent who fits into all settings. The gang leader is a tough individual who runs smalltime criminal operations with an iron fist. This can be a good opponent for a group to face off with at the climax of their first or second session, especially if the gang leader is backed up by a minion group of street toughs.

<br>

##### Militarised Police / Trained Bodyguard

For a hard science fiction setting, we can assume at least some professional soldiers are equipped with full-body exosuits that enhance their strength while protecting them from damage. An exosuit increases the character’s Brawn, soak, and wound threshold, which we’ve incorporated into the profile stats and noted in the equipment. If you use an exosuit trooper without a suit, make sure you remove the increases from the profile stats.

##### Junkie

These men and women have fallen from the grace of society, into the grace of their dealers and "benefactors". High on whatever illicit, mind-altering substance they can get ahold of, they can be dangerous in numbers.

<br>

##### Spacer Wannabe

Spaceers are a rare sight in Opportunity, but their visits live on in somewhat of a local legend. While the original article resembles their high-seas cousins of old; swaggering, uncultured rogues with a taste for plunder and mayhem, this breed have never lived the life - for them it is but a game. More talk than substance.

##### Street Tough

The street tough is one of the go-to villains of any setting. These belligerent petty criminals are a reasonable first opponent for your PCs to beat up without your having to worry that they may kill the group by accident. If you’re worried they may be too tough, however, have them use their studded gloves and deal damage to your PCs’ strain threshold.
